## Description

This application allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) short post-it style notes and image posts. Users can also bookmark their favorite posts and images. <br/><br/>
The app is built with Next.js and TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS, and uses Cloudinary for image storage. Next Auth is used to ensure secure user authentication, while React Dropzone provides a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface for image uploads. PostgreSQL is used as the primary database for efficient data management.<br /><br />
